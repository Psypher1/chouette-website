Cloud hosting website in French

This is the front face for a cloud hosting site called Chouette 

For something different I made the display text French

I did the styling in scss - I ignored those files when I pushed.



Maybe I should push it also


I still haven't decided whether to push the files or not



## Thoughts
- Rebuild with OpenProps
